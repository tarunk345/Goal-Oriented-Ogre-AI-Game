# Goal-Oriented-Ogre-AI-Game
A C# game AI planner that decomposes high-level tasks into primitive actions based on the agent and world state. Supports hierarchical task networks, enabling intelligent decision-making and easy integration with Unity-based game environments.

## Features
- Makes use of Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) to build a decision making structure for the AI to operate on.
- Recursive decomposition of complex tasks into primitive actions.
- Tracks both **world state** and **agent state** for decision-making.
- Designed for Unity integration.
